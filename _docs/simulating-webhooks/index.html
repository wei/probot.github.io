<h1>Simulate receiving webhooks</h1><p>As you are developing your app, you will likely want to test it by repeatedly triggering the same webhook. You can simulate a webhook being delivered by saving the payload to a file, and then calling <code>probot receive</code> from the command line.</p><p>To save a copy of the payload, go to the <a href="https://github.com/settings/apps">settings</a> page for your App, and go to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. Click on one of the <strong>Recent Deliveries</strong> to expand it and see the details of the webhook event. Copy the JSON from the <strong>Payload</strong> and save it to a new file. (<code>test/fixtures/issues.labeled.json</code> in this example).</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This will only receive the JSON payload, not the headers that are also sent by GitHub webhooks.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/173/28491924-e03e91f2-6ebe-11e7-9570-6d48da68c6ca.png" alt=""></p><p>Next, simulate receiving this event being delivered by running:</p><pre><code>$ node_modules/.bin/probot receive -e &lt;event-name&gt; -p &lt;path-to-fixture&gt; &lt;path-to-app&gt;
</code></pre><p>Note that <code>event-name</code> here is just the name of the event (like pull_request or issues) and not the action (like labeled). You can find it in the GitHub deliveries history under the <code>X-GitHub-Event</code> header.</p><p>For example, to simulate receiving the <code>pull_request.labeled</code> event, run:</p><pre><code>$ node_modules/.bin/probot receive -e pull_request -p test/fixtures/pull_request.labeled.json ./index.js
</code></pre>

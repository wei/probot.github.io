<p>This app uses GitHub's deployment API and triggers a deployment event when a matching label is applied to a Pull Request.<br>Note that this app doesn't actually deploy anything, it just triggers a deployment request which will be forwarded to any webhook listening to the deploy event on your repo or on your organization. Check GitHub's <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/">deployment API</a> for more information (this app would be the <em>Tooling</em> box on the sequence diagram).</p>

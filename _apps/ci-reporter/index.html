<h2>Usage</h2><p>Simply <a href="https://github.com/apps/ci-reporter">install the app</a> and watch the magic happen as your Pull Requests trigger failure statuses.</p><h2>How it works</h2><p>When a build fails, the CI provider will tell GitHub (via a status). GitHub then tells <strong>ci-reporter</strong> about a failed status, and it'll find the part of the build that failed, then comment back on the PR.</p><h2>Configuration</h2><p>You don't need any configuration for this to work in your project but you can customize a few things to fit your needs. You can create a <code>.github/ci-reporter.yml</code> file:</p><pre class="language-yml"><code class="language-yml"><span class="token comment"># Set to false to create a new comment instead of updating the app's first one</span><br><span class="token key atrule">updateComment</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean important">true</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># Use a custom string, or set to false to disable</span><br><span class="token key atrule">before</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"✨ Good work on this PR so far! ✨ Unfortunately, the [ build]() is failing as of . Here's the output:"</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># Use a custom string, or set to false to disable</span><br><span class="token key atrule">after</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"I'm sure you can fix it! If you need help, don't hesitate to ask a maintainer of the project!"</span></code></pre><p>If you need more configuration, please <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/ci-reporter/issues/new?title=%5BConfig%5D&amp;body=Can%20you%20please%20add%20the%20___%20config%20option">let me know in a new issue</a>.</p><h2>Does it work with _____?</h2><p><strong>ci-reporter</strong> currently supports TravisCI and CircleCI. If you're interested in seeing support for another CI tool, please <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/ci-reporter/issues/new">open an issue</a>!</p>

<h1>untrivializer</h1><blockquote><p>a GitHub App built with <a href="https://github.com/probot/probot">probot</a> that asks in Github comments if you're really sure something is trivial.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/entendu/untrivializer/master/docs/ss.png" alt="screenshot"></p><h2>But why tho</h2><p>A lot of times we'll write up an issue without really thinking it through:</p><blockquote><p>We want <em>X</em>. Just do thing <em>Y</em> to get it, that should be really simple.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Make change <em>Z</em>, it should be trivial.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Do thing <em>Foo</em>, it's super easy.</p></blockquote><p>Doing those things (almost without fail) takes way, way more time than we think it will. Why? A couple reasons:</p><ul><li>If we're making a comment like that we're probably not thinking through all the little details anyway,</li><li>We're all just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy">terrible at estimating, <em>even when we know we're terrible at estimating</em></a> (it's truly incredible),</li><li>We often forget the downstream repercussions of &quot;simple&quot; changes -- one line of code for you might mean 3 hours or more of code review, testing, etc.</li></ul><p>So this little robot tries to detect when you've said something &quot;should be simple&quot; and asks if that's really the case. The default reply is:</p><blockquote><p>Did you mean, &quot;<em>might be straightforward, but could have unforseen complexities that would completely change the prioritization of the issue, so we should let it go through the normal planning and estimation process</em>&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy">?</a></p></blockquote><p>Detection is an ugly regex.</p><h2>Running</h2><p>I think you can run this as a Github app here: <a href="https://github.com/apps/untrivializer">https://github.com/apps/untrivializer</a> but no guarantees that the backend will stay up. If you'd rather run it yourself (I don't blame you) look below.</p><h2>Setup</h2><pre><code># Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start

<p>Automatically closes Issues where the author hasn't responded to a request for more information.</p><h2>App Workflow</h2><p>The intent of this app is to close issues that have not received a response to a maintainer's request for more information. Many times issues will be filed without enough information to be properly investigated. This allows maintainers to label an issue as requiring more information from the original author. If the information is not received in a timely manner, the issue will be closed. If the original author comes back and gives more information, the label is removed and the issue is reopened if necessary.</p><h3>Scheduled</h3><p>Once per hour, it searches for issues that:</p><ul><li>Are open</li><li>Have a label named the same as the <code>responseRequiredLabel</code> value in the configuration</li><li>The <code>responseRequiredLabel</code> was applied more than <code>daysUntilClose</code> ago</li></ul><p>For each issue found, it:</p><ol><li>If <code>closeComment</code> is not <code>false</code>, posts the contents of <code>closeComment</code></li><li>Closes the issue</li></ol><h3><code>issue_comment</code> Event</h3><p>When an <code>issue_comment</code> event is received, if all of the following are true:</p><ul><li>The author of the comment is the original author of the issue</li><li>The issue has a label named the same as the <code>responseRequiredLabel</code> value in the configuration</li></ul><p>It will:</p><ol><li>Remove the <code>responseRequiredLabel</code></li><li>Reopen the issue if it was closed</li></ol><h2>Usage</h2><ol><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apps/no-response">Configure the GitHub App</a></strong></li><li>Create <code>.github/no-response.yml</code></li></ol><p>A <code>.github/no-response.yml</code> file is required to enable the app. The file can be empty, or it can override any of these default settings:</p><pre class="language-yml"><code class="language-yml"><span class="token comment"># Configuration for probot-no-response - https://github.com/probot/no-response</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># Number of days of inactivity before an Issue is closed for lack of response</span><br><span class="token key atrule">daysUntilClose</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">14</span><br><span class="token comment"># Label requiring a response</span><br><span class="token key atrule">responseRequiredLabel</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> more<span class="token punctuation">-</span>information<span class="token punctuation">-</span>needed<br><span class="token comment"># Comment to post when closing an Issue for lack of response.

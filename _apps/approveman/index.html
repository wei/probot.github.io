<p>ApproveMan is a GitHub app that helps approve pull requests with safe changes.</p><blockquote><p>This is especially useful for protected branches.</p></blockquote><h2>Motivation</h2><p>To maintain the health of repositories, it's important to set up review requirements and continuous integration to make sure every pull request that goes in is good.</p><p>For example, GitHub provides &quot;protected branches&quot; as a way to put hard requirements including passing checks and code review approvals on incoming pull requests.</p><p>However, not all pull requests require human attention.</p><p>For example, it's reasonable for a repository to set up a location with a user's GitHub ID like <code>[project_root]/playground/tianhaoz95</code> to allow developers add quick experiments that they want to keep a record and share with the team.</p><p>In this case, if I want to add some notes in <code>[project_root]/playground/tianhaoz95/my-note.md</code>, there is no reason to ask another developer to review the change.</p><h2>Usage</h2><p>You can configure the behavior by adding rules into <code>.github/approveman.yml</code>.</p><p>Here is an example that, given that my GitHub ID is <code>tianhaoz95</code>, approves all the changes that go into <code>playground/tianhaoz95</code> and <code>docs/personal/tianhaoz95</code>:</p><pre class="language-yml"><code class="language-yml"><span class="token key atrule">ownership_rules</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">directory_matching_rules</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>    <span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> personal projects in experimental<br>      <span class="token key atrule">path</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> playground//<span class="token important">**/*</span><br>    <span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> personal documentation<br>      <span class="token key atrule">path</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> docs/personal//<span class="token important">**/*</span></code></pre><p>Note:</p><ul><li>The default config contains <code>playground//**/*</code> if no config file is provided in the repository.</li><li>All pull requests that modify files within <code>.github</code> the directory is denied regardless of the rules in the configuration for safety.</li></ul>

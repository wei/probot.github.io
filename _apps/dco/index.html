<p>The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full <a href="https://developercertificate.org/">text of the DCO</a>, reformatted for readability:</p><blockquote><p>By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:</p><p>(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or</p><p>(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or</p><p>(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.</p><p>(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.</p></blockquote><p>Contributors <em>sign-off</em> that they adhere to these requirements by adding a <code>Signed-off-by</code> line to commit messages.</p><pre><code>This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer &lt;random@developer.example.org&gt;
</code></pre><p>Git even has a <code>-s</code> command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:</p><pre><code>$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
</code></pre><p>Once installed, this integration will create a <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/">check</a> indicating whether or not commits in a Pull Request do not contain a valid <code>Signed-off-by</code> line.</p><p>Additionally, the DCO creates an override button accessible to only those with write access to the repository to create a successful check.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13410355/42353254-3bfa266a-8074-11e8-80b4-18760c5efeee.png" alt="DCO button"></p>

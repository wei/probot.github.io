<h1>Delete merged branch</h1><blockquote><p>A GitHub app that automatically deletes a branch after it's merged. That's it, enjoy!</p></blockquote><h2>Application logic</h2><p>Only PRs that actually get approved and merged will be automatically flagged for deletion. The usual flow will be as follows:</p><ol><li>Author opens a PR from a feature branch.</li><li>PR gets reviewed and CI runs.</li><li>Reviewer or author merges the PR.</li><li>The feature branch gets deleted by this app.</li></ol><p>The following flow doesn't result in deletion of the branch:</p><ol><li>Author opens a PR from a feature branch.</li><li>PR gets reviewed and CI runs.</li><li>CI fails/PR gets declined.</li><li>Reviewer or author decides to close the PR without merging it.</li></ol><h2>Installation</h2><p>Want to try it out?
